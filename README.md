# Ottr

Ottr is a client-side R autograding package that is designed to be mixed into 
[Otter-Grader](https://github.com/ucbds-infra/otter-grader) to extend it to R Jupyter Notebooks, R 
scripts, and Rmd documents.

For more details about ottr and its usage, see the [Otter-Grader documentation](https://otter-grader.rtfd.io).
